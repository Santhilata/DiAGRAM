## How to use the tool

1. The first step is to create your baseline model by clicking on the menu item “Create your baseline model” and name it. 
  Note: If you have created a model during a previous session you can upload it and start from there.

2. We advise you to check the definitions menu item before you start creating your baseline model. It will give you information about the DiAGRAM network. You can also return to this menu item at any point and you will not lose your progress.

3. Answer nine questions about your digital archive.

4. View your results and see how your risk can be reduced.

5. From there, you can either save your results by clicking on “download” or you can create different scenarios to change your answers and see how it affects your score by clicking on “create a scenario”.
  For example, what if you receive six times as many born-digital records as you currently have over the next 3 years? What if your depositor provided hash values for 100% of the records? What if you changed your storage media to 100% Cloud-based?

6. You can download a report of your results by clicking on “download a report”

To save you work, please download your results.

7. If you want to go a step further and work with the data and probabilities more directly, please click on the “Bespoke”  menu item. Here you will be able to: 

  * Update the probability tables for the model based on the data you have entered
  * Create more complex scenarios by directly manipulating the probabilities used in the model
