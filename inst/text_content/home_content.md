DiAGRAM is an online tool designed to help archivists manage the risks to their digital collections. By answering a <a href='www/final_questions.pdf' target='_blank' download>set of questions</a> relating to archives such as storage media, system security and technical skills, the tool will use statistical methods to calculate the probability that your digital material is preserved.

#### Who created it?

The tool was designed by archivists  from a range of organisations, including a large national institution to local authorities, universities or businesses.  

#### Who should use it?

The tool is based partly on data from UK sources and will give the best results for archives based in the UK however, it will also be useful to archivists working anywhere in the world.

* Understand the risks involved in digital preservation as defined in the model and how the risk events are linked together
* Create a model that reflects the records and practices of your digital archive
* Test alternative scenarios to see how this impacts the risk score
* Download your models and a summary of the results to include in a report or business case
* Upload a model from a previous session and continue exploring scenarios from there

#### How do I use it?

In order to get the most meaningful results from DiAGRAM you will need to have assessed your archive against some digital preservation standards in advance. See 'How to use the tool' for the information you will need to use DiAGRAM effectively.

If you are using DiAGRAM for the first time **it will take about 45 minutes to complete** it providing you have the information you need with you.

**Your results will only be saved within the session** _which will automatically expire after 15 minutes of inactivity. You can click on any of the other pages of the tool and return to your question or your results. If you click away from the tool in your browser your progress and results will be lost._

#### How does it work?

DiAGRAM uses a quantitative approach to digital preservation using a statistical method called a Bayesian network. This is the first time a quantitative approach to measuring digital preservation risk has been attempted. Bayesian networks consider the conditional relationships between variables to compute the probability of risk events occurring. DiAGRAM uses real evidence and data acquired through a structured expert judgement workshop to calculate these probabilities.
