    software emulation and data recovery, nor the ability to investigate and manipulate
    data.
  extra: |-
    The default is based on responses to the JISC digital skills
                survey and how many said that there was full capability within their organisation
                to do file format migration, software emulation or data recovery. (15%)
question2:
  node: System_Security
  type: slider
  definition: A secure system can protect data from deletion or modification from
    any unauthorized party, and it ensures that when an authorized person makes a
    change that should not have been made the damage can be reversed. Definition from
    forcepoint, https://www.forcepoint.com/cyber-edu/cia-triad.
  text: How would you rate the system security within your archive? Questions to consider
    when answering include... Do you have regular security audits? Do you have appropriate
    IT support? Do you check for viruses on acquisition? Do server communications
    go through a restrictive firewall? Is physical access to equipment appropriately
    restricted? Is server access restricted to specific personnel? Is there permissions
    management to archival systems? Do you ensure that no member of staff has access
    to all copies?
  options:
  - Good
  - Poor
  detail:
  - We have a good security system, that is we actively manage access restrictions
    both virtually and physically, we have antivirus software, we performing regular
    audits, etc.
  - We have a poor security system, that is we do not actively manage access restrictions,
    we do not have up to date antivirus software, we do not perform audits, etc.
  extra: |-
    The default is based on responses to the JISC digital skills
                survey and how many agreed that their IT provider supports the requirements of
                the archival activities of your organisation toa large or very great extent and
                that their digital collections are protected with access restrictions/
                permissions. (17%)
question3:
  node: Checksum
  type: grouped slider
  definition: 'A unique numerical signature dreived from a file that can be used to
    compare copies (definition from the DPC handbook: https://www.dpconline.org/handbook/glossary).
    A checksum is needed to ensure integrity of the digital object.'
  text: For what proportion of files do you have a checksum from the depositor? If
    none, for how many have you generated a checksum instantly upon receipt?
  options:
  - 'Yes'
  - Self_Generated
  - 'No'
  detail:
  - We have a checksum from the depositor.
  - We do not have a checksum from the depositor but generated one ourselves instantly
    upon reciept.
  - We do not have a checksum or have only generated one post-ingestion.
question4:
  node: Info_Management
  type: slider
  definition: Internal systems and support for coherent information management and
    documentation of preservation actions. This is needed to ensure integrity and
    provenance of the digital object.
  text: For all your files today, what proportion do you have sufficient internal
    information management systems in place to track the preservation actions since
    acquisition?
  options:
  - Sufficient
  - Insufficient
  detail:
  - We have sufficient internal information management systems to track the preservation
    actions since acquisition.
  - We have insufficient internal information management systems to track the preservation
    actions since acquisition.
  extra: |-
    The default is based on responses to the JISC digital skills
                survey. 70% of respondents agreed that their catalogue management
                system meets the needs of the organisation and 40% that their
                digital asset management system meets the needs of the organisation.
                We have estimated that 55% would therefore have sufficient
                information management systems, as you don't need a bespoke
                digital asset management system to have support for coherent
                information management and documentation of preservation actions,
                but you may need more than just a catalogue system.

    your copies are in the same location and you do not have adequate mitigations
    in case of a flood.

  - 'Yes'
  - 'No'
