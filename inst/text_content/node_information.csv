Tools_to_Render,Availability of tools and software to render the digital material and the expertise to use them.,April 2020,Elicited data,Preservation Planning,BooleanSlider
Technical_Skills,"Bespoke digital preservation skills such as awareness of technological trends, detailed knowledge of storage media, hardware and software, skills to perform file format migration, skills to find emulating software etc?",2019,JISC digital skills survey results,Preservation Planning,BooleanSlider
System_Security,"A secure system can protect data from deletion or modification from any unauthorized party, and it ensures that when an authorized person makes a change that should not have been made the damage can be reversed. Definition from forcepoint, https://www.forcepoint.com/cyber-edu/cia-triad.",2019,JISC digital skills survey results,Preservation Planning,BooleanSlider
Obsolescence,"Essential equipment, hardware or software required to access the bit stream becoming out of date or unusable. For example, hardware no longer being produced or essential software to access the media no longer supported.",April 2020,Elicited data and cloud data storage service level agreements,Preservation Planning,BooleanSlider
File_Format,"A file format is a standard way that information is encoded for storage in a computer file. It tells the computer how to display, print, and process, and save the information. It is dictated by the application program which created the file, and the operating system under which it was created and stored (definition from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_format). The file format can be described as ubiquitous if is widely known and used by non-specialists. If the file format is not proprietary, is can be described as open.

The availability of tools and software to render a digital object depends on the file format.",Jan 2020,TNA data and JISC digital skills survey results,Preservation Planning,BooleanSlider
Checksum,A unique numerical signature dreived from a file that can be used to compare copies (definition from the DPC handbook: https://www.dpconline.org/handbook/glossary). A checksum is needed to ensure integrity of the digital object.,2019,Loosely based on JISC digital skills survey results,Ingest,slider
Tech_Metadata,"Technical information that describes how a file functions and that enables a computer to understand it at the bit level, so that it can be rendered in a way that is faithful to its original content. Definition adapted from: https://www.nedcc.org/fundamentals-of-av-preservation-textbook/chapter-4-introduction/chapter-4-section-5.",April 2020,Elicited data,Data Management,BooleanSlider
Info_Management,Internal systems and support for coherent information management and documentation of preservation actions. This is needed to ensure integrity and provenance of the digital object.,2019,Loosely based on JISC digital skills survey results,Data Management,BooleanSlider
Digital_Object,"Whether it is a born-digital record, digitised record or surrogate.",2019,Loosely based on JISC digital skills survey results and TNA data ,Data Management,slider
Content_Metadata,"Describes the intellectual entity through properties such as author and title, and supports discovery and delivery of digital content. It may also provide an historic context, by, for example, specifying which print-based material was the original source for a digital derivative (source provenance). It also includes provenance information of who has cared for the digital object and what preservation actions have been performed on it. This definition is adapted from the Digital Preservation Metadata Standards publication https://www.loc.gov/standards/premis/FE_Dappert_Enders_MetadataStds_isqv22no2.pdf.",April 2020,Elicited data,Data Management,BooleanSlider
Storage_Medium,The type of media on which the digital material is stored.,2020,Estimates,Archival Storage,slider
Storage_Life,The length of time for which the physical storage device is expected to store the digital object's bit stream. The end of storage life can be described as the point at which you can no longer store or retrieve data due to hardware defects or malfunction.,April 2020,Elicited data and cloud data storage service level agreements,Archival Storage,BooleanSlider
Rep_and_Refresh, Short for replication and rereshment. The archive's policies on making and maintaining copies of digital materials.,2019,Loosely based on JISC digital skills survey results,Archival Storage,BooleanSlider
Op_Environment,"Short for operating environment. The conditions under which the storage media are kept, in terms of their resilience to damage from a flood.",2019,Loosely based on JISC digital skills survey results,Archival Storage,BooleanSlider
Integrity,The assurance that the bit-stream is identical to when it was added to the archive.,April 2020,"Elicit conditional probabilities with some deterministic results
",Archival Storage,BooleanSlider
Bit_Preservation,"A term used to denote a very basic level of preservation of digital resource as it was submitted (literally preservation of the bits forming a digital resource). Activities may include maintaining onsite and offsite backup copies, virus checking, fixity-checking, and periodic refreshment to new storage media.",April 2020,Deterministic mostly but includes elicited data too,Archival Storage,BooleanSlider
Renderability,The object is a sufficiently useful representation of the original file.,April 2020,Deterministic mostly but includes elicited data too,,BooleanSlider
Intellectual_Control,"Having full knowledge of the material content, provenance and conditions of use.",2020,"Deterministic
",,BooleanSlider
Identity,Knowing what the material is and where it is from. Specifically... Can you locate the file? Is it sufficiently described for you to know this is what you want? Can you understand its context within the archive? Can you find other versions of the file which were created by preservation actions? Can you find the provenance of the file?,April 2020,Deterministic mostly but includes elicited data too,Access,BooleanSlider
Conditions_of_Use,"Knowing of the conditions of use and any restrictions on the digital material, including the legal status, copyright, who owns the intellectual property and Freedom of Information restrictions.",April 2020,Elicitation data,Access,BooleanSlider
