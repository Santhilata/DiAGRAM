Storage_Medium,A,"Expected lifespan below 10 years or unknown, highly susceptible to physical damage, requires specific environmental conditions and very sensitive to changes, does not support error-detection methods, supporting technology is novel, proprietary and limited. Examples include USB flash drive, floppy disk, SD drive and CD-R discs."
Storage_Medium,B,"A proven lifespan of at least 10 years, low susceptibility to physical damage, tolerant of a wide range of environmental conditions without data loss, supports robust error-detection methods, supporting technology is well established and widely available. Examples include LTO tapes, blu ray discs and CD-ROM discs."
