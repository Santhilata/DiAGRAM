## Before you start 

In order to get the most accurate result from DiAGRAM you will need to **gather the information you need to answer the questions _before_ you start using the tool** (though feel free to explore the tool in advance by entering any values). **If you need more help, check the Glossary.**

DiAGRAM will help you make a thorough assessment of your archive’s risks. Given the breadth of risk areas covered and number of digital preservation standards used, we suggest you to read all of the questions and familiarise yourself with these standards. This means that you will need to allow a reasonable amount of time to prepare your answers before using the tool. 
You will need to have some information about the composition of your digital holdings and how they are currently stored. For the security questions you may need information from your IT support team or outsourcing partner. 

We use the results of assessments from existing standards. Using these helps standardise responses and make scores more comparable across different institutions. Completing some of the questions will give a far more accurate answer if you have already assessed your archive against them. 

The standards used are,
