## Before you start creating your baseline model, you will need to prepare your answers

In order to correctly assess your risk score, you will need to answer the following questions. 
**We advise you to read all the questions first, and if you need more clarification, please check the 'Definitions' menu item.**
You can download these questions if you wish to prepare your responses offline. 

We use definitions from existing standards to help standardise responses and make scores more comparable across different institutions. Completing the input questions will be quicker if you are already familiar with these standards (and particularly if you have already assessed your archive against them). You will also need to have some information about the composition of your digital holdings and how they are currently stored. For the security questions you may need information from your IT support team or outsourcing partner. The standards used are, for digital preservation concepts:

* the [NDSA Levels of Preservation](https://ndsa.org/publications/levels-of-digital-preservation/) and,
* the [Digital Preservation Coalition’s Rapid Assessment (DPC RAM),](https://www.dpconline.org/digipres/dpc-ram) particularly service capabilities I and J (Content Preservation and Metadata Management).

For security:

* the [UK’s National Centre for Cyber Security Cyber Essentials/Cyber Essentials Plus](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/cyberessentials/overview) and
* [ISO 27001](https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html).

For technical skills:

* the [DigCurV framework](https://www.digcurv.gla.ac.uk/skills.html)

### Q1. Digital Object

What proportion of your digital archive are the following?

* Born_digital (%)
* Digitised (%)
* Surrogate (%)

### Q2. Storage Medium

What proportion of your records are stored on the following media types?

A) less stable,

B) more stable,

C) outsourced data storage.

Definitions of categories:

A) – *Expected lifespan below 10 years or unknown, highly susceptible to physical damage, requires specific environmental conditions and very sensitive to changes, does not support error-detection methods, supporting technology is novel, proprietary and limited. Examples include USB flash drives, floppy disks, SD drives, external hard drives and CD-R discs.*

B) - *A proven lifespan of at least 10 years, low susceptibility to physical damage, tolerant of a wide range of environmental conditions without data loss, supports robust error-detection methods, supporting technology is well established and widely available. Examples include LTO tapes, blu ray discs, enterprise/corporate managed hard drives and CD-ROM discs.*

C) - *An external company is taking responsibility for our data storage. Examples include Amazon Simple Storage Service, Microsoft Azure Archive Storage and Google Cloud Storage.*

### Q3. Replication and refreshment

For what proportion of your files do you have at least one additional copy of the bitstream? And do you have a refreshment policy to ensure you always have at least one additional copy of the bitstream in the event of another copy becoming damaged or lost? 
Answer the proportion of files for which you answer yes to both.

### Q4. Physical Disaster

Based on the Government's long term flood risk assessment, how likely is it that your safest digital storage location will experience a flood? 
Where the risk level varies for different risk types (i.e. flood risks from rivers or the sea, flood risks from surface water, flood risks from reservoirs), please answer based on the highest result.

Single choice option: ‘Very Low’, ‘Low’, ‘Medium’, High’

### Q5. Operating Environment

Do you have a copy of the material stored in a different geographical location? If not, do you have adequate mitigation strategies in place in case of a flood? Factors to consider include building design, location of storage media within the building, having flash flood doors and sandbags etc. Answer 0% only if all your copies are in the same location and you do not have adequate mitigations in case of a flood.

### Q6. Checksum

For what proportion of files do you have a checksum from the depositor? If none, for how many have you generated a checksum instantly upon receipt?

Single choice option: ‘Yes’, ‘Self-Generated’ and ‘No’

### Q7. System security

a) 	Does your organisation hold a recognised security accreditation (or has it carried out equivalent assessments)?

Single choice option: ‘No’, ‘Cyber Essentials’, ‘Cyber Essentials Plus’, ‘ISO27001’

b) 	Has a penetration test specifically targeting your archival systems been conducted? If so, are any issues identified outstanding?

Single choice option: ‘No test’, ‘Critical issues outstanding, ‘Severe issues outstanding’, ‘None, or only minor issues outstanding’
      
c) 	At what level is your archive for the Control functional area of the NDSA Levels of Preservation?

Single choice option: ‘Not achieved, ‘Level 1’, ‘Level 2’, ‘Level 2’,’Level 3’

d) 	Is a virus check performed for all material stored in the archive, and the result recorded?
Single choice option: ‘No’, ‘Yes’

### Q8. Information Management

a) 	Assess your archive against the Metadata functional area of the NDSA Levels of Preservation

Single choice option: ‘Not achieved, ‘Level 1’, ‘Level 2’, ‘Level 2’,’Level 3’

b) 	Assess your archive against the Content functional area of the NDSA Levels of Preservation

Single choice option: ‘Not achieved, ‘Level 1’, ‘Level 2’, ‘Level 2’,’Level 3’

c) 	Assess your archive against the Service capability, I - Content preservation, of DPC RAM

Single choice option: ‘0 - Minimal awareness’ , ‘1 – Awareness’, ‘2 - Basic’, ’ 3 - Managed’, ‘4 – Optimized’

d)      Assess your archive against the Service capability, J - Metadata management, of DPC RAM

Single choice option: ‘0 - Minimal awareness’ , ‘1 – Awareness’, ‘2 - Basic’, ’ 3 - Managed’, ‘4 – Optimized’

### Q9. Technical Skills

Please consider the following statements about digital preservation skills taken from [the DigCurV curriculum framework for digital curation](https://www.digcurv.gla.ac.uk/skills.html). For each skill, rate the level of skill in your organisation on the scale indicated.

Single choice option for each statement: ‘None, ‘Basic’, ‘Intermediate’, ‘Advanced’
