These are defined as:

* Renderability: The object is a sufficiently useful representation of the original file.
* Intellectual Control: Having full knowledge of the material content, provenance and conditions of use.

The risk prevention probabilities below are calculated on the answers inputs you gave combined with data in the underlying network.
